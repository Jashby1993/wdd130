            <h2> Overview</h2>
            <h3> Purpose</h3>
            <p> 
                The purpose of this site is to draw attention to my business, and to drive people to book rafting trips. White water rafting
                is about teamwork, cooperation, and connecting to and respecting nature.
            </p>
            <h3> Audience</h3>
            <p>
                Who are the target customers? Describe their life (or business) situation.
                Target customers: Coporate team building activities- These will be modern companies, maybe with a younger workforce,
                with stable income, and diverse interests. They'll be looking for a trip of average lenth, brief sets of moderate difficulty
                but with plenty of time to relax and discuss, with an experienced guide giving guidance but letting the team work together.
                Weekend warriors- Groups looking to try something new. Diverse ages, but mostly groups of friends or families, of moderate income.
                They'll want a guide really taking the reigns, and a fairly easy stretch.
                WWR Veterans- Experienced white water rafters that don't have their own equipment. 30's to 40's, moderate income. They'll want difficult 
                stretches of river, and if they want a guide it will be to guide through the river itself, not how to "do it"
