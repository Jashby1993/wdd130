            <p> My name is Justin Ashby, and I am just now getting back to college after a seven year break. I am 30 years old, I've been married to Elisangela for 7 years,
                 and I have 3 beautiful children: Amelia, who is 3; Elliot, who is 15 months; and Rylee, who is now a month
                  old. I decided to go back to college because I wanted to make a career change, and I took out a few
                   library books to see what I thought, and felt prompted that this is the right thing to do now!</p>
                   <p>My hobbies include reading, boardgames, hiking, listening to music, hammocking (that's the verb form of being happy in a hammock),
                    and cooking. But with three kids under three, I don't have time for much of that, except the last one. I also
                    played double bass from middle school to college, and the dream is to get back into that. I also enjoy playing
                    backyard sports: ultimate frisbee, three on three football, and driveway basketball. My favorite place to hike
                    is American Fork Canyon, or by Bridal Veil Falls in Provo Canyon.
